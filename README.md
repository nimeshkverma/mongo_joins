# mongojoin
**Joins on Mongo**

This is an attempt to provide people using MongoDB - and fetching related data from different collections rather frequently - with a library to combine data from more than one collection (*Read 'joins'*)

MongoDB is a  de-normalized database and does not offer methods to perform "join" action on collections.

Feel free to raise issues and contribute !

Preliminary documentation can be found in **DOCUMENTATION.md**
