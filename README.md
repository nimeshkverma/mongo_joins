<b>Joins on Mongo</b>

This is an attempt to provide people using MongoDB - and fetching related data from different collections rather frequently - with a library to combine data from more than one collection (<b>Read "Joins"</b>)

MongoDB is a  de-normalized database and does not offer methods to perform "join" action on collections.
